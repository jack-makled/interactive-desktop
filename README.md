## Colored Squares
#### a simple interactive desktop

This Python uses Tkinter & the Nord color scheme to generate a fun little "desktop" on your computer. The app forces itself to the background of your apps, and if you click on part of the generated desktop, it'll change colors (again based off the Nord color scheme).

This is in the "alpha" stages. I'm mainly messing around with it because it's fun.

#### To-dos & Future Features
* Allow users to choose their own color scheme.
* Add more options for patters & shapes to use in generation.
* Will soon add a feature where it'll automatically start changing tile colors.
* Find a better way to force the app into the background.
  * It basically "checks" every hundred ms to make sure it's in the background, and can cause some weird flickering if you're playing with it while other windows are open.
